ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SamanthaMotz and write scripts to automate tasks for other IT service providers. With over 20 years of experiance in the IT industry, I have learned a lot about what it takes to get things done. I have written hundreds of scripts to automate work that would have taken thousands of hours to perform manually. Most of my work is private but I'm working on converting my most popular scripts into open source versions. If you see a script here that you want to have customized for your needs or need something similar but for a different platform, let me know. You can message me here.
